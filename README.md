# How to Run the Vigilo App (Deployed Version)

Follow these simple steps to run the app on your computer:

---

## 📁 Step 1: Make Sure the Model Folder Exists

There should be a folder named `models` that already contains the file:

```
shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
```

✅ *Note: This is already included in the zip file you downloaded — you don’t need to do anything here!*

---

## 📦 Step 2: Install Required Tools

1. Open a terminal or command prompt inside this folder.
2. Run this command to install everything needed:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

## 🚀 Step 3: Run the App

In the terminal, type this command and press Enter:

```
python app.py
```

---

## 🌐 Step 4: Open in a Browser

After running the app, it will give you a link like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

1. Copy that link.
2. Paste it into your web browser.
3. The app will now run locally on your computer.
